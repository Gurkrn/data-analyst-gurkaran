# Project Title: Titanic Survival Analysis
Objective and Aim
This project aims to analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on various factors such as passenger class, gender, and overall demographics. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques, we identify key trends and patterns in survival outcomes, providing insights into the factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

Methodology
The dataset used for analysis is the Titanic dataset, which contains details about passengers, including their class, gender, age, fare, and survival status.

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, categorizing variables, and performing statistical calculations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to visualize survival distributions.

A dashboard was built using Dash and Plotly to present survival analysis interactively.

Key visualizations include:

Overall Survival Rate (Pie Chart) – Displays the proportion of survivors and non-survivors.

Survival Rate by Passenger Class (Bar Chart) – Illustrates how survival rates differed across first, second, and third-class passengers.

Results and Findings
    The overall survival rate was 36.4%, while 63.6% of passengers did not survive.

Survival rates by passenger class:

    First-class: 46.7% survival rate.

    Second-class: 32.3% survival rate.

    Third-class: 33.0% survival rate.

First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, suggesting a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and survival probability.

Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate, reinforcing the "women and children first" evacuation policy.

Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rates, likely due to their cabins being in the lower decks, limiting accessibility to lifeboats.

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how socioeconomic status, gender, and class significantly influenced survival on the Titanic. The findings provide valuable insights into historical survival patterns and highlight the potential for further predictive modeling. Future work could involve applying machine learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes, enhancing data-driven decision-making in similar scenarios.

# PROJECT 2


# Understanding Customer Purchase Patterns at XYZ Retail
Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of customer purchase patterns at XYZ Retail. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to identify key trends, consumer behaviors, and insights that can inform marketing strategies and inventory management.

Methodology
Data Collection & Preparation

Generated a synthetic dataset of 1,000+ transaction records with key details such as Transaction ID, Customer ID, Purchase Date, Product Category, Quantity, Price, Payment Method, and Store Location.

Cleaned the data by addressing missing values and correcting data types.

Descriptive Analysis & Visualization

Sales Trend Over Time: Analyzed total transactions per month to identify peak shopping periods.

Top Product Categories: Identified the most frequently purchased product categories.

Payment Method Distribution: Examined customer preferences for different payment options.

Customer Segmentation & Insights

Segmented customers based on purchase frequency and behavior.

Derived insights to optimize inventory, promotions, and marketing strategies.

Results & Findings
📊 Sales Trend Over Time

The highest number of transactions occurred in August 2023 (104 transactions), indicating a peak shopping period, possibly due to seasonal promotions.
