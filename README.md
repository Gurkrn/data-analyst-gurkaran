# Project Title: Titanic Survival Analysis
Objective and Aim
This project aims to analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on various factors such as passenger class, gender, and overall demographics. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques, we identify key trends and patterns in survival outcomes, providing insights into the factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

Methodology
The dataset used for analysis is the Titanic dataset, which contains details about passengers, including their class, gender, age, fare, and survival status.

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, categorizing variables, and performing statistical calculations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to visualize survival distributions.

A dashboard was built using Dash and Plotly to present survival analysis interactively.

Key visualizations include:

Overall Survival Rate (Pie Chart) â€“ Displays the proportion of survivors and non-survivors.

Survival Rate by Passenger Class (Bar Chart) â€“ Illustrates how survival rates differed across first, second, and third-class passengers.

Results and Findings
    The overall survival rate was 36.4%, while 63.6% of passengers did not survive.

Survival rates by passenger class:

    First-class: 46.7% survival rate.

    Second-class: 32.3% survival rate.

    Third-class: 33.0% survival rate.

First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, suggesting a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and survival probability.

Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate, reinforcing the "women and children first" evacuation policy.

Third-class passengers had the lowest survival rates, likely due to their cabins being in the lower decks, limiting accessibility to lifeboats.

Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates how socioeconomic status, gender, and class significantly influenced survival on the Titanic. The findings provide valuable insights into historical survival patterns and highlight the potential for further predictive modeling. Future work could involve applying machine learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes based on passenger attributes, enhancing data-driven decision-making in similar scenarios.

# Diagnostic Analysis of Sales Decline at XYZ Retail

Objective & Aim

This project investigates the reasons behind the decline in sales at XYZ Retail over the past year. By analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, and transaction data, the goal is to identify key patterns and correlations that explain the downturn. The findings will provide actionable recommendations for improving sales performance and optimizing business strategies.

Methodology
Trend Analysis

Examined monthly sales trends to identify periods with the most significant sales declines.

Correlation Analysis

Conducted statistical regression analysis to measure the relationship between sales and variables such as time, inventory levels, customer behavior, and external factors.

Root Cause Analysis

Used techniques such as the "5 Whys" and Fishbone Diagram to explore potential causes, including operational inefficiencies, competitive influences, and consumer behavior shifts.

Segmentation Analysis

Categorized customers based on spending behavior and location to determine which groups are most affected by the decline.

Results & Key Findings
Sales have shown a steady decline over time, with an estimated monthly drop of approximately $1,317, as confirmed by regression analysis (p = 0.007).

The most significant declines were observed in July and November, indicating possible seasonal trends or external economic factors.

Furniture and Electronics were the best-selling product categories, with total sales of $83,637 and $77,682, respectively.

Digital payments accounted for the highest transaction amounts ($134,767), suggesting a shift toward online and cashless payments.

Customers in Chicago and Los Angeles had the highest average transaction values (~$267), while those in New York had the lowest ($243), highlighting regional differences in purchasing behavior.

Visualizations & Findings
Sales Decline Over Time
Monthly sales data revealed a downward trend, with the most significant declines observed in July and November.

Regression analysis indicated a strong negative correlation between time and sales, with an average monthly decrease of approximately $1,317.
